# Fair Jewelry Distribution

## Problem Statement

Alice has a collection of `n` valuable jewelry items, each with a specific value. She wants to divide some of these items between her two children, Bob and Carol, such that both receive at least one item. Alice’s goal is to ensure fairness in the distribution by minimizing the difference in the total value of the items given to Bob and Carol.

Your task is to help Alice determine a way to distribute the jewelry between Bob and Carol that minimizes the difference in their respective total values.

## Input

- A list of `n` positive integers `values`, where `values[i]` represents the value of the `i`-th jewelry item.

## Constraints

- $2 \leq$ `n` $< 500$
- $1 \leq$ `values[i]` $< 2^{32}$

## Output

- A list of `n` integers `output`, where `output[i]` has to be one of the following:
  - `0` — the `i`-th item is kept by Alice.
  - `1` — the `i`-th item is given to Bob.
  - `-1` — the `i`-th item is given to Carol.

## Example

### Input 1

```sh
[39, 44, 9, 57]
```

### Output 1

```sh
[1, -1, 1, 0]
```

### Explanation 1

One way to distribute the items:

- Bob gets items with values 39 and 9, for a total of 48.
- Carol gets the item with a value of 44, for a total of 44.

The difference between their total values is $∣48 − 44∣ = 4$, which is minimized. The item with value 57 is not distributed in this case.

In addition, `[-1, 1, -1, 0]`, `[0, 1, 1, -1]`, and `[0, -1, -1, 1]` are all considered correct.

### Input 2

```sh
[853940629, 1315585648, 2300059246, 3725772056, 3641218997, 2153420534, 2627838160, 397993035, 3945211594, 108811287, 2390692858, 1948858746, 2663071899, 1055037841, 4176315661, 2508371863, 1375994650, 548381905, 1152870032, 2683832974, 948081281, 2202150278]
```

### Output 2

```sh
[-1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 1, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, -1]
```
