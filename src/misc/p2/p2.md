# Minimize Subset Sum Difference

### Problem Statement

You are given a list `arr` of `n` positive integers. Your task is to select two non-empty, non-overlapping subsets such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimized. Determine the minimum possible difference between the subset sums.

### Constraints

- $ 1 \leq $ `n` $ < 2^{32} $
- $ 1 \leq $ `arr[i]` $ < 2^{32} $

### Input

- A single integer `n` — the number of elements in the list.
- A list of `n` positive integers `arr` — the list to select subsets from.

### Output

- A single integer representing the minimum possible difference between the sums of two non-empty, non-overlapping subsets.

### Example

#### Sample Input

```sh
4 
39 44 9 57
```

#### Sample Output

```sh
4
```

#### Explanation

One possible way is to choose subsets {39, 9} and {44}. The sums of the subsets are 48 and 44, respectively, so the difference is $ |48 - 44| = 4 $.
